The following files were provide documentation of the continuous work for our final project. Many of these files may not necessarily be fully debugged nor organized in a clear way for a future reader. Comments and docstrings may be omitted as we developed this project.

The files found in the Final folder *have* been carefully revised and debugged for future users and readers. 

A song.wav file is included for testing purposes.

In > Partial_Animations, you can find the MP4 outputs from some of the ipynb to see the progression of animation.
